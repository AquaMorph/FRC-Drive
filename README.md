# FRC Drive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AquaMorph/FRC-Drive.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/AquaMorph/FRC-Drive)

A mobile version of the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®) Driver Station. This app will allow one to connect to a robot and drive it through an Android device. This app is an open beta and still prone to bugs. I am planning on adding more features as time goes on. I would gladly take suggestions for improvements. I am an Alumni and Mentor for FRC® Team 2059 The Hitchhikers.

Features:

 - Simplistic Holo Interface
 - Teleop and Autonomous modes
 - Two onscreen joysticks and throttles with full 12 buttons each
 - USB and Axis selection
